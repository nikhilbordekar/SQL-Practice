        "\n",
        "**Using Subqueries Efficiently:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Subqueries can help improve query efficiency by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. For example, you can use a subquery to retrieve a specific value that you then use in the main query. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a table `orders` and a table `customers`. You want to retrieve orders made by customers with a specific last name. You can use a subquery to first find the customer IDs with the desired last name and then use that result in the main query:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- Subquery to retrieve customer IDs with the last name 'Smith'\n",
        "SELECT customer_id\n",

        "**Impact of Inefficient Subqueries:**\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, poorly designed or inefficient subqueries can negatively impact query performance. For instance, using a subquery that retrieves data for each row in a result set can be inefficient. Consider this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose you have a table `employees` and you want to find employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of all employees. Using a subquery to calculate the average salary for each row can lead to poor performance:\n",

        "FROM employees\n",
        "WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the subquery is executed for each row in the `employees` table, which can be resource-intensive for large datasets. A more efficient approach would be to calculate the average salary once and then use it in the main query.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using Efficient Subqueries:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a more efficient way to achieve the same result:\n",

        "WHERE salary > (SELECT avg_salary FROM avg_salary_cte);\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, a common table expression (CTE) is used to calculate the average salary only once, and that result is then used in the main query. This approach is more efficient as it avoids redundant calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, subqueries can impact query efficiency positively when used wisely to break down complex tasks, but they can also lead to performance issues if used inefficiently. Understanding when and how to use subqueries effectively is essential for optimizing SQL queries."
